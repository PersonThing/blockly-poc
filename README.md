# Blockly Sample App

In this app, we have a few custom blocks, variadic parameters in the `add` and `subtract` blocks, custom json and javascript generation for our blocks.

It is buggy. Not all block types are implemented in the json generator (in fact, only the custom ones and a few built-in ones are). The json generation is not that great.

It is intended as a starting point only.
